This is a simple decompiler for 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. It takes in a
disassembled listing generated by gpdasm. It reads the header file supplied by
gputils (currently hard-coded for the PIC16F876a). Further,
addExtraRegisterMappings() establishes redundant register mappings not defined
in the header. The decompiler then traces the execution flow, expands the
program and data addresses, taking into account PCLATH and banking. It detects
functions and marks up execution branches. The output is another listing that is
hopefully much easier to read than the original.

The whole program is very immature and has many shortcomings (and likely
bugs). It IS mature enough to be generally useful, though.
